## Introduction

The OAIEvals Collector is a Go application specifically designed to collect and store raw evaluation metrics. It provides an HTTP handler & FileSystem Watcher for receiving metric data, a set of utilities for event handling and monitoring, and supports containerized deployment with Docker for ease of use and scalability.

The application integrates seamlessly with InfluxDB for robust and efficient storage of numeric-based time series data, Loki for storing and retrieving log data, providing context and qualitative information around numeric metrics, and now with TimescaleDB for storing and managing event data. All three systems can be used independently or together, depending on the nature of the metrics and the requirements of your system.

The purpose of the OAIEvals Collector is to facilitate the monitoring and evaluation process by providing a one-stop solution for metric collection.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the OAIEvals Collector, you'll need to have the following installed:

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) (version 1.14 or later)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) (version 20.10 or later)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (version 1.28 or later)

Please ensure you have these prerequisites installed and properly configured before proceeding with the setup of the OAIEvals Collector.

## Usage

The OAIEvals Collector is designed to be deployed as a containerized application, with its services orchestrated by Docker Compose. The application can be configured using environment variables.

**Preparation:**

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.

**Start Services:**

1. Run `docker-compose up` to start the OAIEvals Collector, InfluxDB, Loki, and TimescaleDB. Docker will pull the images (if not already present) and build the OAIEvals Collector image.

**InfluxDB, Loki & TimescaleDB Setup:**

1. While the services are spinning up, navigate to your InfluxDB, Loki and TimescaleDB instances and generate an authentication token. These tokens will be used by the OAIEvals Collector to connect and interact with the databases.

**Configuration Setup:**

1. Once you've obtained the tokens, stop the running Docker Compose services (using CTRL+C or `docker-compose down` command).
2. Open the `.env` file (create one based on the provided `.env.example` if it does not exist), and replace `your_token_here` in `INFLUXDB_TOKEN=your_token_here`, `LOKI_TOKEN=your_token_here`, and `TIMESCALEDB_HOST=your_token_here` with the tokens obtained from InfluxDB, Loki, and TimescaleDB respectively.

**Restart Services:**

1. Re-run `docker-compose up`. Now, the OAIEvals Collector should be able to connect to the InfluxDB, Loki, and TimescaleDB with the provided tokens.

**Test the Application:**

You can test the OAIEvals Collector by sending a POST request with a payload representing an event. For instance:

"shell
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '
{
  "run_id": "2307080128125Q6U7IFP",
  "event_id": 3,
  "sample_id": "abstract-causal-reasoning-text.dev.484",
  "type": "match",
  "data": {
    "correct": false,
    "expected": "ANSWER: off",
    "picked": "undetermined.",
    "sampled": "undetermined."
  },
  "created_by": "",
  "created_at": "2023-07-08 01:28:13.704853+00:00"
}' http://localhost:8080/events
"

## Dependencies

The OAIEvals Collector relies on [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/), [Loki](https://grafana.com/oss/loki/), and [TimescaleDB](https://www.timescale.com/) for storing collected metrics. Ensure you have instances of InfluxDB, Loki, and TimescaleDB available for the application to connect to.

## Build and Run

### With Docker Compose

A Docker Compose file is provided for convenience, which will start up the application and instances of InfluxDB, Loki, and TimescaleDB:

1. Build and start the services: `docker-compose up --build`

### Locally

1. Build the application: `go build -o oaievals-collector .`
1. Run the application: `./oaievals-collector`
